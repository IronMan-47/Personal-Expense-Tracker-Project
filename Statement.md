PROJECT STATEMENT
Project Title: Personal Expense Tracker System

Problem Statement
I notice that a student or a young professional often ignores management. The big costs such, as tuition or rent are easy to see. The small daily costs such, as snacks, travel fares, stationery and subscriptions add up. Financial management suffers when those small costs pile up and cause a budget shortfall at the end of the month. The core issues identified are:
Memory Fallacy: Relying on notes to track spending is unreliable. Often forgotten. Manual Tedium:
I see that physical notebooks are often not, at hand when the transaction happens. Physical notebooks cause data gaps.

Complexity of Existing Solutions:
I have found that most expense tracking apps in the market focus on devices and expense tracking apps also fill the screen with ads. Expense tracking apps ask for permissions such as linking a bank account. Many users feel uneasy, about permissions. In my experience there is no desktop tool, for users who spend most of the time at a computer. I have tried programs. Users want an lightweight desktop tool that lets users type quickly with the keyboard. Users do not want to use an interface. The simple offline lightweight desktop tool does not exist.

Scope of the Project
I am describing the scope of the project. The scope of the project is to build a desktop console application using Python that works as a diary. The system will use data management ideas. The system will support CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete. The system will also save data to files.

In-Scope:
        Developing a Command Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction.
        Implementing a robust backend using Python’s standard libraries.
        I have found that using the CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, for data storage works. The CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are simple.
        Providing basic analytical capabilities (summation and categorization).

Out-of-Scope (for this version):
        Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements (buttons/windows).
        Integration with online banking APIs or cloud storage.
        When I look at the system I notice that the system only supports an user. The system does not need multi‑user authentication.
        Multi-currency support.

From my view the main audience, for this software includes:
- University Students have pocket money. University Students need to track campus expenses such, as food, printouts and transport.
- Freelancers/Developers spend hours on the desktop. Freelancers/Developers prefer command line tools that fit the workflow. Freelancers/Developers avoid switching devices.
- Privacy-Conscious Users want to track their finances. Privacy-Conscious Users are the people who care about privacy. I notice that Privacy-Conscious Users do not want to share the data. Privacy-Conscious Users do not want to share the data, with third‑party apps or cloud services.

High-Level Features
I have built the system. The system will have these functions:
- Expense Logging: The system provides an input screen. The user can type the product name choose the category such, as Food or Travel enter the price and pick the date.
- Automated Persistence (Auto‑Save): The system saves each entry to the file expenses.csv right after it is entered. The system saves the data automatically. The system prevents data loss if the power goes out or the program stops.
- Expense Management – View: The system shows a table that lists all expenses. Edit: Let users correct fields. For example fix a price. Users do not need to re‑enter the record. Delete: Delete the duplicate entries using an ID system. Search & Retrieval: A function to look up specific transaction IDs to verify past spending. Financial Analytics: A reporting feature that calculates the Total Expenditure and provides a Category-wise Breakdown, helping users identify their highest spending areas.
